PRECISE FIGURE PLACING

Preamble
</font></h3>

I have put a lot of effort into this contribution to Matlab Central. As I 
used the code successfully for myself for quite some time, I am sure that it can 
be rather valuable for the one or the other. If you find any errors or bugs, 
if you have problems in using the function or if you find the documentation 
insufficiently detailed:

<h4><font color="#660000">

<h3><font color="#000080">Introduction
</font></h3>

This contribution provides functions for precisely placing a figure to a given 
screen location, like the upper left corner, the top half of the screen or the 
full screen. The figure is placed precisely adjacent to the screen borders and 
will not overlap the task bar at the screen bottom. In order to achieve this, 
the left and right borders of a figure as well as the height of the figure head, 
the menu bar etc. are obtained by analyzing a screen shot of a test figure.

<h3><font color="#000080">Installation
</font></h3>
Unpack all files into a single directory. Add path to the directory (using 
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">addpath</font>) to be able to call 
the functions from any other directory.

<h3><font color="#000080">Main functions contained in this package
</font></h3>

<b><font color="#000080">placefigure.m
</font></b><br>
<p>Function to place an existing figure to a given screen location. Please 
read the help comment for details.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">
<p>fh = figure;<br>
placefigure(fh, 'top left');
</p></font>

<p>Example 2:</p>
<font face="Courier New" color="#000080">
<p>
fh1 = figure;<br>
fh2 = figure;<br>
fh3 = figure;<br>
fh4 = figure;<br>
placefigure(fh1, [2 2 1 1]);<br>
placefigure(fh2, [2 2 1 2]);<br>
placefigure(fh3, [2 2 2 1]);<br>
placefigure(fh4, [2 2 2 2]);<br>
</p></font>

<b><font color="#000080">placefiguredemo.m
</font></b><br>
<p>Starts a demonstration of the capabilities of this package.</p>

<b><font color="#000080">computefiguresizeinfo.m
</font></b><br>
<p>Retrieve figure size information like the left and right border widths, 
the height of the menu bar and the figure head, as well as the height of 
the task bar at the bottom of the screen by generating a test figure with 
changing background color and analyzing screen shots of the figure.</p>

<b><font color="#000080">getfiguresizeinfo.m
</font></b><br>
<p>This function calls function computefiguresizeinfo.m and stores the 
information in a file in a temporary directory. If the figure size 
information was retrieved once for the current screen size before, it only 
has to be loaded and the test figure is not needed.</p>

<b><font color="#000080">deletefiguresizeinfo.m
</font></b><br>
<p>If the figure size information saved locally is invalid or outdated (for 
example due to a change of the task bar height, run function 
deletefiguresizeinfo.m to delete the stored information.</p>

<b><font color="#000080">getscreensizeinpixelspc.c
</font></b><br>
<p>This is a mex-function which allows to dynamically get the screen size
taken from <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=10957">
this</a> contribution to Matlab Central. It has to be compiled once on each 
host. Compilation will be started automatically when the function is needed the 
first time.</p>

<h3><font color="#000080">
Known issues
</font></h3>  
<p>The retrieval of the task bar height is expected to work only if the 
task bar is at the bottom of the screen. Further, the analysis of a screen 
shot is not extremely &quot;fail-safe&quot;. If it fails on your machine, 
please let me know.</p>

<p>This package does not work under Octave, as the root/figure properties 
are different.</p>
